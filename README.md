# The Relationship Between Bitcoin and Nvidia's Volatilities

## Description
I had an abstract idea where I decided to correlate volatilities between Bitcoin and Nvidia as Nvidia GPU's are used heavily in Bitcoin mining and these are my results. There are three seperate code files with the first one graphing the volatility relationship, the second one conducting a statistical arbitrage trade on a single combination of test statistics, and the third one generating a 3D chart based on several inputted entry and exit test statistics.
